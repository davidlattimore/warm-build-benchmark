# A Rust warm-build benchmark

This repository is just intended as a benchmark for warm build times of Rust code with a substantial
number of large dependencies.

To run the benchmark, run:

```sh
./run-benchmark
```

The accompanying blog post is (Speeding up Rust edit-build-run
cycle)[https://davidlattimore.github.io/working-on-rust-iteration-time.html].
